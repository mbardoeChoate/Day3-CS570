# Day 3 Classwork

Today we want learn about lists and tuples. We saw a python list 
yesterday. There are ways to change a list, and one of the most important
is to append. 

```buildoutcfg
x=[1,2,3] 

x.append(4) # x = [1, 2, 3, 4]

```

We will also work on making commands for a robot to move in a circular
motion. In order to move in a circular motion your components of the 
velocity need to follow the pattern of sine and cosine. 

Your goal today is to make a list of 100 velocities that we 
we would want our robot to be going, so that the robot follows a circle.

Python doesn't have a sine and cosine function, but it has a ```math``` 
 package that has those functions.

Take a look at the code. And work in groups of 2 to complete the task.
